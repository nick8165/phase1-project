Project title: Local Tournament Bracket Creater

Motivation: As this will be my first "built from scratch" webpage, I thought something relatable to my interests would help fuel my passion to create something I'm familiar with but with a small twist.  The passion stems from watching streams of Super Smash Brothers tournaments which led to the idea of giving small local tournaments and maybe even a house party of guests the ability to set up brackets and record wins for future data or, a time stamp of your wins across multiple meet ups with your friends.


How to use: 
- Bracket sizes are set to four, eight, or sixteen players.

- Once that is chosen from the "Number of participants" select bar, the User can register a name with a gamertag of choice and optionally a birthday.

- After that, place the registered players inside of the bracket using the search bars.  *Note*  Gamertags will be case sensitive so that jondough and JonDough are considered two seperate players. If a tag was placed incorrectly, use the "X" delte button to reset the search bar.

-When the bracket is all set with players the User can track the wins by using the "+" button to increase the set number or the "-" button to offset a misclick.

-This code is set to track a best 3 of 5.  So once a player reaches 3 wins the number of wins will turn green and add a 1 set win total to that players registered gamertag.

-Next place the winning players into the next round of brackets until a grand finalist is chosen.
